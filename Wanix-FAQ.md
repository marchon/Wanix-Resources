@progrium  So to start, I am new and blown away here. I have had my head in your project for almost 24 hours a day for 4 days in a row. (thats LITTERALLY - I TAKE PROVIGIL - have you ever seen the ABC news report on viagra for the brain so yes almost 100 hours trying to wrap my head around it.)  I have to say, its almost like magic. You guys were so clevery, I take my hat off to you. But I have a large number of questions, and I have watched all of the talks that I have found from you online. - I hope that there are more, or more reference docs somewhere that I cant find; but here is a list of questions.  

1) I was wondering first in the filesystem module, can additional file system mounts come from oci containers? 

2) It looks like I should be able to edit the shell to bring up my own web application. 

3) I would like to layer a growing WORM (Write Once Read Many) filesystem, where individual oci layers can be created and mounted or loaded. 

4) I would like to be able to have a user be able to download a new wasm app by clicking a download button and having it regenerate with the contenets of the contenets of the BROWSERFS for the app.  (which I think is somewhat like what you do now - but not sure)

Hello @progrium could I get a chance to plan a time with you in wanix-live to discuss some things that I am trying to fill in some holes in my mental model .  After getting some sleep from my research binge as mentioned above, I have done a bunch more research, and have some additional questions. If you take the time - and answer my questions, I will do a writeup of the discussion, to be shared with the community in any way that you wish.  If you would prefer, we could hold a meeting / Q&A session in my zoom room, record it, and have AI transcribe it, and i will contribute additional commentary, and you can put it on a website somewhere. Would you consider any of that? Would if I offered to pay you a small fee, would that motivate you any more? I think it would be very helpful to me, and potentially other members of the community interested in Wanix capabilities.

It might make more sense to just write up the questions so I can answer async
